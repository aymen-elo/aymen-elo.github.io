I am a final year, Master of Engineering Student in Computer Science at CESI École d'ingénieurs, doing an Apprenticeship as a Software Analyst at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

My passion lies specifically in Software and Data Engineering alongside Machine Learning with an interest in Asset Management, Quantitative Finance and Quantum Computing.
