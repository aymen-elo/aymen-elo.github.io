I am a final year, Master of Engineering Student in Computer Science at CESI École d'ingénieurs, doing an Apprenticeship as a Software Analyst at AXA Investment Managers.

I have the opportunity to do a 5-week research internship, which I want to do in Machine Learning. My interest lies specifically in applying Machine Learning to Asset Management and I am also exploring the Quantum computing field.

Currently following inria's (Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn)[https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/].
